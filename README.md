## :v: Hi there, I'm Jesus!

I am Software Developer and Graphic Designer from Colombia, also passionate about art and video games. I'm working as fullstack developer, I enjoy the frontend but I also like to know what's going on behind the scenes. :nerd_face:	 :rocket:

I like to constantly explore and research technology and new practices, exchange knowledge in developer communities, and learn more and more with the best disposition and always open to new ideas.

- :computer: I like use React, Node, Postgres, Mongo and Python for coding, most of the time.
- :man_artist: I'm a lover of art, I am Illustrator, also a tattoo artist and piercing apprentice.
- :clapper: I enjoy good cinema and literature, to spend time.
- :art: Sometimes I like to dabble in UI Design.
